R allows data analysis interactively, by means of scripts or also by programming complete programmes. The functionality of R can be extended as desired by using ready-made additional packages or by programming routines oneself. R is particularly well suited as a first programming language, as high productivity can be achieved even with little prior knowledge. R supports the approach of literate programming, which enables easy reproducibility and traceability of data analyses. Therefore, R is a complete solution from data analysis to publication.",

abstract="``R'' is a free software environment which helps to analyse, compute and present statistical information and graphics. It works with packages, some of which are already installed in ``R'', others need to be downloaded and loaded into ``R''. R-studio is a simpler interface of ``R'' and is easier and more intuitive to use. However, to use R-studio, you must also install the full version of ``R''. This chapter explains how to install both ``R'' and R-studio, how R-studio works and how to create objects, basic functions and other fundamental features. Coding in ``R'' can be intricate, so this chapter demonstrates straightforward examples. It also introduces ``scripts'' (text files containing commands), which are extensively used in ``R''.",

abstract="From the mid-twentieth century, the digital age started changing every aspect of human life by utilizing information technology advancements. Informatics is a field of science that makes use of these signs of progress to transform data and information into required knowledge that can be used by humans efficiently. Bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field of science, was developed mainly because of the parallel development of molecular biology, computer science and the recent emergence of big data. It analyses and interprets, a huge amount of biological data that has been generated by sequencing techniques and genome projects. The increased number of bioinformatics tools, biological big data and changes in computer architecture in recent times have raised the need for more expertise in the field. Thus, this chapter highlights the basic understanding of bioinformatics approaches including the databases, tools, and their diverse application in different fields such as biology and drug design and development. It also discusses diverse approaches to tackling biological complex networks and understanding disease conditions. The significance of bioinformatics has been growing due to continual research and making the availability of new and updated resources for the interpretation of biological data.",
